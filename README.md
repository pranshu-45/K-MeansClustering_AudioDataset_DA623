# K-MeansClustering_AudioDataset_DA623
DA623 Tutorial


This repository contains python notebook and audio dataset.
Python notebook contains k-means clustering algorithm run on this audio dataset.
Audio dataset contains 60 different .wav files, which I recorded from a piano.
Each sample contains a 3-4 second sound with a single note being played.

For running the python notebook yourself, download the dataset, upload it on your google drive and mention the folder's path in the global variable initialised in the start of the file.
